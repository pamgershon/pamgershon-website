  <section id="fees">
    <h2>Fees and Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Gershon does not participate with any insurance plans, so clients pay her directly at the time of service. However, because she is a Licensed Psychologist, many clients receive some level of reimbursement for her services.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may want to ask your insurance company about your coverage for individual therapy with an "out of network" Licensed Psychologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fee is based on the length of your session. Most clients come once a week for a 50-minute session, but some clients find it useful to schedule longer or more frequent sessions or sessions every two weeks. Please contact Dr. Gershon for current fee information.
    </p>
